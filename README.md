# Using Excel to Analyze the Outcomes of Kickstarter Campaigns

In this project, I analyzed the outcomes of Campaigns on Kickstarter to find which campaigns are more likely to be successful.

First, I used conditional formatting through color scales to determine whether or not the state of a campaign was successful, failed, canceled, or live. Then I used conditional formatting through color scales to better see the percentage funded of each of the campaigns.

Second, I split the category and sub-category into separate columns to be able to make different pivot tables to analyze more specifically.

Third, I converted the timestamps to dates to make a pivot table based on the timeline from start of campaigns to their deadlines.

Fourth, I calculated the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled campaigns based on their goal and made a simple line chart.

Last, I added alt text to all graphs and charts.
